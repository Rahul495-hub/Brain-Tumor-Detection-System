# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System


Project Overview
This project implements a CNN-based model to classify brain MRI images as tumorous or non-tumorous. Key features:

Binary classification with 88.7% test accuracy 1.

Data augmentation to handle dataset imbalance and improve generalization.

Streamlined preprocessing: Brain cropping, resizing, and normalization.

Gradio-based web demo for easy testing
